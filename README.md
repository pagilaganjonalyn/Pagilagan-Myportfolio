  # Reflection
  Creating a portfolio in GitHub was both a challenging and rewarding experience. One of the main challenges I faced was learning how to properly use Git and GitHub for version control. At first, I was confused about the difference between local repositories and remote repositories, which led me to make mistakes such as pushing incomplete files or committing changes to the wrong branch. To solve this, I reviewed online tutorials, practiced basic Git commands, and followed step-by-step guides until I became more comfortable with the workflow. Another challenge was organizing the structure of my portfolio files so that it would look clean and professional. I solved this by creating separate folders for images, stylesheets, and scripts, which helped keep the project organized and easy to update.

I also struggled with designing the portfolio to look visually appealing while ensuring it remained simple and responsive. To address this, I referred to sample portfolio templates, experimented with CSS properties, and tested the design on different screen sizes. Through trial and error, I managed to build a layout that reflected my personal style while being functional.

For future improvements, I would like to make the portfolio more interactive by adding JavaScript features such as animations or light/dark mode. I also plan to enhance the content by including more detailed project descriptions, screenshots, and links. Finally, I want to continuously update the portfolio as I gain more skills and complete new projects, ensuring it grows alongside my development as an IT student.
